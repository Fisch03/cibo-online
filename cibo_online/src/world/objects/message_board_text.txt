update 1 is out!

new things:
- this very blackboard! it'll be updated with newly added features and changes, so keep an eye out for it!
- a map! press M to open it and see where the heck you are going...
- painting! go over to the atelier to draw something, share it with other tabemonos and even get it added to the world!
- graffiti! head over to any camera-facing wall and press G to leave your mark! anyone could draw over it though so be careful... and don't be a jerk >:(
- a buncha changes under the hood that will make adding new stuff quicker from now on!
